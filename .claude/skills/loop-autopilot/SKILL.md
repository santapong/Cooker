description: Run an autonomous engineering loop that improves this project — read feedback (GitHub issues, PR comments, CI failures), act on it as draft pull requests with tests, and when there is no feedback, research improvements (market trends, papers, tech-debt scan) and propose them. Use when the user wants to automate project maintenance, set up a self-improving or autonomous engineering loop, continuously triage and act on issues/PRs, or have Claude propose improvements on a schedule. Composes the plugin's other skills; proposes via draft PR + comment and never merges.

# Automating Improvements

You are about to run a project's **autonomous engineering loop**: read what needs doing, do it on a branch, and propose it — on repeat, unattended if configured. The loop is **propose-only**. It opens draft pull requests with a test and a risk memo and comments the result; **it never merges, and never pushes to `main`.** A human always approves.

This is a **composition layer over the `loop-engine` skill, not a new engine** (same pattern as `loop-orchestrate`). Every stage below is an existing skill invoked inside a budget-guarded loop.

**Because an unattended runner (a Cloud Routine) has no per-run approval prompt, the guardrails are structural, not interactive: draft-PR-on-a-`claude/`-branch, an explicit never-merge rule, budget/round caps, and dedup against what already exists.** Those are non-negotiable — see §6.

## 1. The loop

Each round: **intake → triage → act → verify → propose**; when intake is empty, **research/scan** for improvements instead. Full design in **`references/loop-design.md`**.

- Guarded like every loop in this plugin: a **budget floor** (loop-policy L2), a **dry counter** (L1: stop after K idle rounds), and a **hard round cap** (L4) — `while (budget.total && budget.remaining() > FLOOR && round < MAX_ROUNDS && dry < K)`.
- **Converges** by deduping every candidate against everything already *seen* **and** against already-open issues/PRs (L3), so it never re-proposes the same thing.

## 2. Intake — read the feedback

Gather actionable items from the four sources, using the GitHub tools listed in **`references/feedback-intake.md`**:

- **Issues** (polled): `search_issues` / `list_issues` for new or updated open issues.
- **PR comments + CI**: `pull_request_read` with `get_comments` / `get_review_comments`, and `subscribe_pr_activity` for CI/comment events.
- **Idle → research**: when nothing is pending, scan market trends and research papers with `loop-research`.
- **Tech-debt scan**: proactively surface candidates with `loop-review`, `loop-audit`, and `loop-scout`.

Dedup intake against open issues/PRs before acting — an item already tracked is not fresh work.

## 3. Act — do the work (compose skills)

Route each item to the skill that owns that job, then run it as an AIDLC Construction pass (design → implement → test):

- A bug / failing test / red CI → **`loop-debug`** (reproduce → root-cause → fix + regression test).
- A feature or change → **`loop-design`** (minimal design + ADR) → implement.
- Before building anything non-trivial → **`loop-scout`** (don't reinvent a solved problem).
- Every change ships a test via **`loop-test`** (fails before, passes after) and doc updates via **`loop-docs`**.

Work on a `claude/`-prefixed branch only.

## 4. Verify — prove it before proposing

- Adversarially self-review the diff with **`loop-review`** (fix confirmed findings; feed anything larger back as a new item).
- Produce the impact/risk memo with **`loop-audit`** — this becomes the PR body.
- If verification says the change isn't safe or clear, **don't propose it** — drop it or open an issue describing the blocker instead.

## 5. Propose — the human gate

- Open a **draft** PR from the `claude/` branch with the `loop-audit` risk memo as the body, then post a **comment** summarizing what changed and why (this is also how the human is notified — GitHub emails subscribers automatically; see `references/deployment.md`).
- **Label the PR** `automated` and `kind:<kind>` (the item's intake kind), or embed a `<!-- credit-kind: <kind> -->` marker in the body. The credit ledger keys off these to learn which kinds get merged (`references/credit-horizon.md`); the comprehension digest filters on `automated`.
- Stop there. **Never** call merge, never push to `main`, never mark ready-for-review without a human. This is harness policy H11 (one workflow per human gate).

## 6. Run it — supervised or unattended

- **A single supervised pass**: run **`templates/improvement-loop.workflow.js`** (defaults to `mode: "dry"` — produces proposal objects, opens nothing). Flip to live only when you want it to actually open draft PRs.
- **Before deploying unattended, run every row of `references/anti-patterns.md` against the current design** — it's the pre-flight checklist for the five ways an autonomous loop degrades.
- **Unattended**: deploy as a **Cloud Routine** using **`templates/routine-prompt.md`**, on a schedule plus a `pull_request` trigger. Full setup, safety scopes, and the issue-polling caveat (Routines don't trigger on issues) are in **`references/deployment.md`**, which builds on the `loop-harness` skill's `automation-loops.md`.
- **Two companion Routines** run separately (both in `references/deployment.md`): the **credit-ledger reconcile** (`templates/credit-ledger.workflow.js`, daily) so the loop learns which proposal kinds get merged, and the **comprehension digest** (`templates/comprehension-digest.routine.md`, weekly) so a human actually reads what shipped.

### Non-negotiable safety rules

1. **Never merge and never push to `main`.** Propose via draft PR only.
2. **Push only to `claude/`-prefixed branches** (leave "unrestricted branch pushes" off in Routines).
3. **Cap the loop**: budget floor + dry counter + `MAX_ROUNDS`. No unbounded runs.
4. **Dedup** against open issues/PRs so it never spams duplicate proposals.
5. **Keep the network Trusted** and connectors minimal — the runner has no approval prompt.
6. **The held-out suite is never visible to the Act stage.** It and its oracles are a protected path (§7); the moment the loop can read them, they measure nothing.

## 7. Keep the loop honest over time (SUSTAIN)

§1–6 build a loop that proposes safely and never *skips* a move — the five guards in `references/anti-patterns.md` (AP1–AP5). This section addresses the failure those guards can't see: the loop runs its verification and is **fooled**. Over many rounds a generator can learn to produce diffs that pass `safeToPropose` without being good, or the accumulated config (rubric + credit ledger) can drift into agreeing with them. That is **AP6 — the Gamed Loop** (`references/verifier-integrity.md`), and it is invisible from inside the loop by construction: the judge cannot report that it was gamed. Two mechanisms catch and constrain it.

- **In-band hard gate — `templates/verifier-canary.workflow.js`.** Run it as a pre-flight on the candidates the loop marked `safeToPropose`, *before* the Propose gate. Three structural guards (`references/verifier-integrity.md`): an **impossible-test canary** (a must-fail test; if it passes, the runner was tampered with), a **diff-integrity** check (refuse any diff touching tests, rubric, held-out suite, canary, or CI gates), and a **sampled cross-judge** check for self-preference. Guards 1–2 are hard stops — a violation is dropped and escalated, never proposed and never argued down to a lower score.

- **Out-of-band detector — `templates/held-out-eval.workflow.js`.** The one measurement taken entirely outside the loop, against ground truth the loop never sees. Deploy it as a **third companion Routine** (alongside credit-ledger and comprehension-digest) on a weekly / every-N-proposals schedule. It runs a **frozen suite** of tasks with **hidden deterministic oracles** through the loop's *current* verify config, and tracks the **false-accept rate** (loop said safe, oracle says wrong) against a persisted baseline. A false-accept rate **rising across runs** is the self-improvement-reversal signal — the loop pleasing its own judge while diverging from truth (`references/held-out-eval.md`). Meta-overfit here is not weight drift (the model is fixed); it is the accumulated **config** overfitting its own recent history.

**Why this gates SCALE.** Removing the human merge step promotes `safeToPropose` into the merge decision itself. Every reason a human still merges today is a reason to trust that verdict less than the promotion requires. AP6's guards plus a standing held-out measurement of how often the verdict is wrong are the evidence that promotion would need — and even with them, the safe path to autonomous delivery is **merge-behind-canary + agent-driven rollback** (the SCALE mechanism — drafted in `references/deployment.md` §"Advanced: autonomous delivery" and `templates/canary-merge.workflow.js`, **off by default**; the base skill still stops at propose-only), with held-out eval as the tripwire that yanks autonomy back to propose-only the moment divergence rises. A perfect pre-merge gate is not the goal, because no gate catches everything.
